            My name is George Vasiliadis.  Born, and still living, in Melbourne, I've lived a few different lives, from studying adveritising, to becoming a qualified Carpenter, and now finally pursuing a career in computer programming.  Starting off as a Web Developer, studying at the Coder Academy Institute, I'm excited to work and grow in what feels like a limitless industry. 
            Learning new skills is important to me, it helps me to open doors for myself and gain new perspectives, letting me support myself, but more importantly others.
